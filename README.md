# Harvard Applied Math/Engineering Science 115
This Git repository contains example codes from the course Applied Math 115 Mathematical Modeling at Harvard.

## Modules

- [Population (single species, deterministic, Part 1)](https://github.com/zhimingkuang/Harvard-AM-115/tree/main/01_population_single_1)

## Run code

- MATLAB (local machine): navigate to the target folder and run MATLAB scripts
    
- [MATLAB Online](https://matlab.mathworks.com/): first need to create a new project by cloning the repo, then navigate to the target folder and run MATLAB scripts

> Caveat: MATLAB scripts can run interactively online, but have not found a way to update the cloned repo in if new files are added

- Python (local machine): need local Python and Jupyter installation to run notebooks

- Python ([Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb)): click "Open in Colab" badge on the top of each `.ipynb` notebook to run (no need to install anything for Python to run)

> If you are running the notebook on Google Colab, please make a copy of the notebook to your drive:
>
> - click "Copy to Drive"
> - or navigate to "File -> Save a copy in Drive"
> - or navigate to "File -> Download" and save a local copy
>
> Otherwise all your changes will not be saved
